NATURAL LANGUAGE CALCULATOR
---------------------------------------

Start the webserver by executing the script 'server.py'. The webserver
will host its contents on the loopback interface at port 8080. Navigate
your browser to

tive numbers you can use the '-' sign or the word 'minus' that has to be directly
prepended to the number definition.
